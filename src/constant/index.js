    question: "When does the competition run?",
    answer:
      "The competition runs from December 5 to 20, 2025 (15 days). You can sign up and download the app anytime, but we recommend starting before December 5 to ensure your setup is correct and you're ready to compete from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I sign up for the competition?",
    answer:
      "You can sign up in three ways: (1) Fill out the driver signup form, (2) Text SIGNUP to our WhatsApp number, or (3) Download the PathPulse app using the Timo link and complete onboarding. All three methods will get you registered for the competition.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the prize structure work?",
    answer:
      "The R17,300 prize pool is distributed across three stages: Top 20 drivers receive rewards, Top 15 drivers earn bonuses, and Top 10 drivers win the largest share. This means multiple drivers win prizes throughout the competition, not just at the end.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are winners chosen?",
    answer:
      "Winners are determined by your leaderboard ranking, which is based on: (1) App activity and data collection time, (2) Quality of route data captured, and (3) Consistency of participation. The leaderboard updates in real-time inside the PathPulse app.",
  },
  {
    question: "What data do you collect?",
    answer:
      "We only collect anonymized location and route metadata while you drive. This includes traffic patterns, route information, and travel times—all anonymized. We never access personal files, photos, or other data on your phone. Your privacy is protected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to keep the app open while driving?",
    answer:
      "No, you don't need to keep the app open. Once you've enabled location permissions, the app runs in the background and automatically collects data while you drive. Just make sure location services are enabled on your phone.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I track my progress?",
    answer:
      "You can check your ranking anytime by opening the PathPulse app and viewing the leaderboard. We'll also send regular updates via WhatsApp with leaderboard snapshots, competition tips, and prize announcements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need help or have questions?",
    answer:
      "We're here to help! Text SIGNUP or message our WhatsApp number, email us at hello@timorides.com, or reach out through the signup form. Our team will respond quickly to help you get set up and answer any questions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the TimoRides × PathPulse partnership?",
    answer:
      "TimoRides and PathPulse are partnering to improve transportation in South Africa. By participating in this competition, you're helping build better routing and mobility intelligence while earning cash prizes. PathPulse is already working with the Indian government—this pilot brings similar benefits to South Africa.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start competing after December 5?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can join the competition at any time during the December 5 to 20 period. However, starting earlier gives you more time to accumulate points and climb the leaderboard. We recommend starting before December 5 to ensure everything is set up correctly.",
